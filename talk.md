# Scientific Communication: oral presentations

## Oral research communications

Most important question: What is the **purpose** of the talk?

Types of talks you might encounter

- Research talks: one research result (1-2 papers, 10-30 minute slot).
- Seminar talks: one research program (1 lab, over a few years, 45-60 minute slot).
- Keynote talks: one research field (many labs, over decades, 60-90 minute slot).
- Outreach talks (to lay people, e.g., TED talks): many formats.
- Lectures (like this one!)

Many lessons apply to all these types of talk, but there are specificities too.
We are focusing here on the _research talk_ context: a presentation of less
than 30 minutes of novel scientific work to an audience of peers.

**This lecture has too much text to be a good research talk**!

## Purpose of the talk

To **whom** are you presenting?

What do they know? What should they know _after_ you present?

Scientists at a conference are (generally):

- knowledgeable and smart.
- very busy and will see 20 presentation + 50 posters that day.

---

## Structure

Many structures are possible. A generic one is

1. Background
2. Specific problem
3. Your results
4. Conclusions

---

## Context → specific problem

Often, this is called _the introduction_, but I find that word overly broad.

What you need to do is **take the audience from where they are to where you
are**. The purpose is to make the audience care about the specific question
that you studied.

Explain/discuss:

- Broader context (scientific/societal)
- Current/previous solutions (limitations, trade-offs)

This is where you need to think "what does your audience know? What do they
care about?"

Avoid clichés or statements that are obvious to your audience, no need to say
_Studying the brain is important for understanding cognition_ in a neuroscience
meeting!


---

## Present your work

- This part should at least 50% of the time.
- It is **your work**, it can be plural you (your group's work), but it is
  should be _new_ material (for the audience)..
- Do not present more background than necessary.
- Even if you are presenting a paper, you do not need to present **the whole
  paper**. It can just be an advertisement to get people to read/cite it.

This is thinking of a _research talk in a field-focused conference_, an invited
talk at a department to a broader audience can be different.

---

## Narrative

Tell a story. This does not mean _the real story of how you got to the
results_. That can be interesting and is one way to do it, but not always the
best. What is meant by _story_ is _a **scientific story**_, namely it means
that there are natural, logical, transitions between slides and not just one
thing after another.

---

## Summarize at the end

- Repeat the _key points_.
- Not too many.

_Tip_: when preparing **start with the summary slide**. In 10 minutes, you will
be able to transmit 2-3 points, _every slide_ should serve to reinforce these
points (if they don't, either toss them out or revise the narrative).

---

## Clearly signal when you end

- Often, it is appropriate (even required) to acknowledge co-authors/funders/...
- Make sure people know when you are done, do not trail off.
- Some people say _I will take questions_, but let the chair do that (if there
  is one).

---

## Timesplit

Assuming you have 10 minutes:

1. Background (2 min)
2. Specific problem (2 min)
3. Your results (5 min)
4. Conclusions (1 min)

---

## Be respectful

1. Keep to the time limit (including leaving time for questions!). It is better
   to be short than long, but not too short either (take 90-100% of the time
   you are given).
2. Briefly acknowledge the invitation and the audience.

---


## Slides

- Slides are for support.
- You _can_ use material from manuscripts &c, but slides are their own format.
- Reuse is good, but each talk is different.
- Less is more (bigger fonts: many projectors can only do low quality
  projections, even today).
- _Content-full_ animations and _pre-prepared_ callouts are excellent, but do
  not over-use
- Be polished: no spelling mistakes, consistent use of colour/style,...

---

## Slides/delivery

- You need to explain what you are showing. Explain the axes on plots.
- You should not be reading.
- Look to the audience.
- Watch your body language.

---

## Handling questions: in preparation

When you practice, there will be things that your test audience will point out
or ask. Remember, the goal of practice is _to improve the presentation_. If
there is a question in practice, you should:

1. improve the slides/delivery to make the question go away.
2. prepare supplemental material if that question comes up live.
3. be prepared to answer the question if it comes up, but realize that there is
   never a perfect presentation for everyone.

Normally, the first practice will involve a lot of #1, then if you polish more
and more, you have feedback that falls into group #2/#3.

---

## Handling questions: live

People will (hopefully) ask you questions!

If you know the answer immediately:

- answer it, but keep the answer short. You can use formulations such as
  _[SHORT SUMMARY], and I can go into more detail offline/during the coffee
  break_
- clearly mark where you are speculating, _I do not have the data for it, but
  my intution/mental model is ..._ or _one thing that is consistent is that..._
- engage with the person.

If you do not:

- deflect, _while I do not have an answer to that exact question, we did do
  analysis X_ (obviously, only if analysis X is _somewhat related_). You can
  then transition smoothly into speculation if appropriate.
- say _I don't know_ or _that was outside the scope of this project_.

Almost always, there will be a small set of questions that keep coming up
(which is why _preparation is important_), for those you can pre-prepare
additional material.

You can follow-up during the break (network)!

---

## Pace

- Rules of thumb are mostly useless: _30 seconds per slide_, _one minute per
  slide_, _two minutes per slide_, ... Really depends on your style and some
  slides may require 10x more time than others.
- Do not be faster than if you were writing on the whiteboard.
- If you have issues with English, **slow down**.
- Prepare _Breadcrumbs_ ("after 3 minutes, I should be finishing slide 4").

---

## Practice

- Practice _the talk_.
- Not just writing the slides, but the talk as a whole.
- Practice sections: a particular group of slides, even a single slide.
- Practice the end!
- Leave it natural.

You can have notes, but **do not read** too extensively:

- I often have 1 small note with _breadcrumbs_.

---

## You be you

If you work across disciplines, it will often happen that you may be presenting
to an audience that is not 100% in your field. You need to _adapt_, but still
present _your research_.

You will need to

1. Pay attention to jargon (avoid/explain)
2. Avoid references to work that "everyone knows" in your field (maybe it is
   not so well known) or _inside references/jokes_

You may end up present _less_ material in the time alloted: for example, if you
are a computational person presenting to an applied audience, the best use of
your time may be to present _the intuition behind your algorithm_ and some
empirical evidence, leaving out any formal analyses altogether. This is
perfectly fine.

Do **not** try to present something inferior to please the audience (e.g., some
speculations from your work which are only weakly supported, but fit what you
_think the audience wants_).

---
## Avoid doing the following

- _I am going to skip this_: why is it there?
- _Ignore this side of the plot_: why is it there?
- _Since I am running out of time, let me skip this section_: why were you not
  paying attention to time before?

This is just bad preparation.

- Avoid _laundry lists_: "this is X, this is Y, this is Z, ...". Either you
  need more lack narrative structure (instead of "these are the results of X
  analysis", say "X analysis confirmed/disproved the hypothesis") or need to
  cut things out.

---

## Do not oversell/undersell

### Do not oversell

- be precise, present numbers and context

### Do not undersell

This is common in junior researchers.

Often, it is just a matter of re-framing. Example:

- if it your method works in a limited type of data (or your results are
  confined to a single experimental system), you can say _our method is the
  best for datasets with fewer than 5,000 datapoints_ instead of _we do not
  work well on large datasets_.

---
## Avoid elements that only make the audience more confused

For example, having mathematical formulas which *are tangential to the point*
normally adds _no information for the people who are know what you mean_ but
_confuses those who do not_.

Instead of _y* = X · argminβ { |y - Xβ|² + λ₁|β|₁}_, write "using a linear
model".

This does not mean, _avoid formulas_. If they are _relevant_ and you take the
time to explain them and are presenting to a mathemically-literate audience,
your whole presentation can be a series of formulas.

---

## Being nervous is normal

- Famous athletes get nervous before coming on the field!
- A bit of stress is good, too much is not.
- Learn how to manage/decrease your stress (personal).
- Watch out if you speed up/slow down when nervous.
- Rely on your preparation (breadcrumbs, initial statements, ...).
